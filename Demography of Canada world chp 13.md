### **Demography of Canada world** p.317-322



**Introduction** -at what point will the world's resources fail to support its population? 



**World population growth** -exponential growth, the world growth is accelerating.



**Demography** -the statistical study of human populations, and helps you understand the consequences of population change.



**Census** -an ancient way back in Egypt and Rome, it allowed rulers to determine the number of people. today it's collecting data like collecting taxes, or doing a survey. a census in summary is data about the population.



**Developed country** -sometimes known as 1st world countries, its much easier to count the people then it is in other countries, because of technology, taxes and etc. still hard to count homeless people.



**Developing country** -much less accurate, because the country is much more poor, and may not be able to count the people in remote areas. and laws like in China where you must have x amount of kids but if you have more, then they won't be counted.



**crude birth rate** -used to find the ratio, they use per 1000 rates. the formula is: 
Births / Population x 1000



**crude death rate** -same method as above, just replace births with death.



**natural increase** - deaths - births = natural increase.

(3 facts above, do NOT include immigrants)


[rule of seventy]
**exponential rate** - kind of like a family tree, couple has 4 kids, which those 4 kids turn the family into 8, then 4 couples have 4 kids each, then turning the family a big number. but this time its 1, 2, 4, 8. it doubles. 



**doubling time** - is approximately equal to: 70 / x% = y
Better formula from ChatGPT (it's a search engine):
T=ln(1+r)ln(2)â€‹


**immigration rates** - entering the country, calculated the same as crude birth rate.



**emigration rates** - leaving the country, calculated the same as crude birth rate.



**net migration rates** - immigration rates - emigration  = that.

**Population Growth rate** - Birth rate - Death rate -+ Net migration rate = that

**Life expectancy**

**The demographic revolution**

**Demographic transition**

**Age structure**

**dependency ratio**

**Population pyramid**

**cohorts**

**Canada's population: the past and the future**

**Dependency: too young or too old**

**Case study**

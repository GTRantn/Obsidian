### **Demography of Canada world** p.317-322



**Introduction** -at what point will the world's resources fail to support its population? 



**World population growth** -exponential growth, the world growth is accelerating.



**Demography** -the statistical study of human populations, and helps you understand the consequences of population change.



**Census** -an ancient way back in Egypt and Rome, it allowed rulers to determine the number of people. today it's collecting data like collecting taxes, or doing a survey. a census in summary is data about the population.



**Developed country** -sometimes known as 1st world countries, its much easier to count the people then it is in other countries, because of technology, taxes and etc. still hard to count homeless people.



**Developing country** -much less accurate, because the country is much more poor, and may not be able to count the people in remote areas. and laws like in China where you must have x amount of kids but if you have more, then they won't be counted.



**crude birth rate** -used to find the ratio, they use per 1000 rates. the formula is: 
Births / Population x 1000



**crude death rate** -same method as above, just replace births with death.



**natural increase** - deaths - births = natural increase.

(3 facts above, do NOT include immigrants)


[rule of seventy]
**exponential rate** - kind of like a family tree, couple has 4 kids, which those 4 kids turn the family into 8, then 4 couples have 4 kids each, then turning the family a big number. but this time its 1, 2, 4, 8. it doubles. 



**doubling time** - is approximately equal to: 70 / x% = y
Better formula from ChatGPT (it's a search engine):
T=ln(1+r)ln(2)â€‹


**immigration rates** - entering the country, calculated the same as crude birth rate.



**emigration rates** - leaving the country, calculated the same as crude birth rate.



**net migration rates** - immigration rates - emigration  = that.


**Population Growth rate** - Birth rate - Death rate -+ Net migration rate = that


**Life expectancy** - the average number of years that an individual is expected to live, of a little more then 30 years. disease, poor medical care, poor nutrition and unsanitary living conditions can contribute to shower life expectancy and higher death rates.


**Demographic transition** - it shows changes over a period of time in 3 elements, births, deaths and trends in population. it shows how history affected population such as stage 1 where life is very unstable, you may get a diseases at any time and die, which caused many deaths. at stage 2, you had the industrial revolution and medical innovations such as vaccines and clean drinking water, which caused the death rates to fall rapidly leaving a big gap, the high population was caused because of the many children the earth needed for humanity to survive. at stage 3 people realized that many kids were no longer needed since people now live longer, birth rate declines. at stage 4, kids become expensive, so families commonly have up to 3 kids. at stage 5, the amount of old people there is become most of the population, then people die, and death rates go up.


**Age structure** - helps understand the reasons in population change.


**dependency ratio** - the working ratio, meaning the percentage of amount of people who contribute towards the governments economy like paying taxes.


**Population pyramid** - a graph that shows the age and sex structure 


**cohorts** - a series of horizontally placed bar graphs to make the sex structure of the pyramid.


**Canada's population: the past and the future** - we are made of a bunch of immigrants entering the country, which our population growth consist of. and we also have a really old population that might die soon.


**Dependency: too young or too old** - no one to maintain the economy can lead to problems like, raised taxes or worse quality of life. having no one to support the economy is a bad thing.


**Case study** - the one child policy in China, expected to reduce fertility rates, because the government officials believed having too much population would strain their economy and resources. but instead it caused issues like gender imbalancement because parents didn't want girls, some even went unreported meaning they had no ID, no passport and no record of them being there (an issue for the census).


**Population distribution** - refers to the way people are spread over the earth's surface. 


**Ecumene** -  the name for the planet earth, or the permanently inhabited places. 


**Population density** - describes the number of population in a given area.


**Crude density** - the formula to finding out population density is: population / total land


**arable** - the amount of untouched land, that can be used to grow food, resources and fresh water. people think the shortages for this land is increasing.


**Carrying capacity** - the amount of people the world can sustain before naturally leveling off.

**Nutritional Density** - the amount of food per land, useful to find out if a place has not enough food or enough food like America, which has too much food.

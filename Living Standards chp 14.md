## **Introduction**:
each year the United nations publish a human development report, the report contains adult literacy rates, life expectancy and GDP. this is obviously made for developing countries, where they have the biggest issues with education, health and the economy. its also to bring awareness to those poorer countries so that people like us can help, and maybe make the government contribute.

**per capita GDP**: the total value of all goods / population = per capita GDP.
Japan has 32,475$ per capita
Chad has 1,016$ per capita

**Human development index**: a chart that shows how developed a country is based on Life expectancy, adult literacy rate and GDP per capita. this report overall shows what is the best country to live in.

## **The divided Planet:**
the planet has a massive gap between developed countries and developing countries.

**Developing countries**: commonly known as 3rd world countries, most of the countries are in Africa or countries that intersect the equator.

**Developed countries**: commonly known as 1st world countries, that have a good economy and infrastructure. most of them are in the northern hemisphere.

**Highly indebted poor countries**: developing countries that owe lots of money to developed countries, but is near to 0% of a chance to pay it off. 

**Newly industrialized countries**: new countries like Indonesia which are industrializing by building factories and producing more goods.

**Comparing living standards**: the living standards in developing countries is the same as being in the wilderness without any food or resources around, (its terrible).

**Percentage share of World GDP by countries**: 20% of the richest countries own 86% of the world's economy, meaning that there is a really big gap.

**Measuring Poverty**: its important to measure poverty because poverty in Canada is much better then poverty in a country like Chad or Niger.

**Scatter graph of GDP, observation**: we can obviously see that there is a big gap, between the poor countries and the developed countries.

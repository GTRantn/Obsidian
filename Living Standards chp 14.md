## **Introduction**:
each year the United nations publish a human development report, the report contains adult literacy rates, life expectancy and GDP. this is obviously made for developing countries, where they have the biggest issues with education, health and the economy. its also to bring awareness to those poorer countries so that people like us can help, and maybe make the government contribute.

**per capita GDP**: the total value of all goods / population = per capita GDP.
Japan has 32,475$ per capita
Chad has 1,016$ per capita

**Human development index**: a chart that shows how developed a country is based on Life expectancy, adult literacy rate and GDP per capita. this report overall shows what is the best country to live in.

## **The divided Planet:**
the planet has a massive gap between developed countries and developing countries.

**Developing countries**: commonly known as 3rd world countries, most of the countries are in Africa or countries that intersect the equator.

**Developed countries**: commonly known as 1st world countries, that have a good economy and infrastructure. most of them are in the northern hemisphere.

**Highly indebted poor countries**: developing countries that owe lots of money to developed countries, but is near to 0% of a chance to pay it off. 

**Newly industrialized countries**: new countries like Indonesia which are industrializing by building factories and producing more goods.

**Comparing living standards**: the living standards in developing countries is the same as being in the wilderness without any food or resources around, (its terrible).

**Percentage share of World GDP by countries**: 20% of the richest countries own 86% of the world's economy, meaning that there is a really big gap.

**Measuring Poverty**: its important to measure poverty because poverty in Canada is much better then poverty in a country like Chad or Niger.

**Scatter graph of GDP, observation**: we can obviously see that there is a big gap, between the poor countries and the developed countries.

## **The Poverty Trap**:
its estimated that 800 million people in developing countries are starving or malnourished. even though, the world produces enough food for 6 billion people. and maybe even more.

**The cycle of poverty:** a baby gets born, it doesn't get enough food, the baby's develops slowly, it has poor performance in school, low literacy level causes less likelihood of economic development, baby grows into a adult later in life, and gets married at a young age, since they don't have education, they have many kids and no money. (the cycle repeats)

**The burden of death:** IMF and world bank provide risky loans to countries that can't pay it off, therefor since they can't pay it off most of their economy goes towards the repayment. which makes life even worse. they are stuck in this 20 feet hole with no ladder or any tools.

**World bank and IMF:** the companies that would provide loans to governments, they were mainly established after world war 2 for cities to rebuild.

**Kenya trapped in poverty**: the stereotypical country you expect to fail because of bad farmland, no way to get money and having corrupt government leaders.

**World bank leading by region graph:** East Asia and pacific are leading.

**Highly indebted poor countries map:** countries that are high in debt and can't afford to repay causing them to spend more money on repayment then healthcare.

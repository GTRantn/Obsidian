Note to my self: I may have missed some terms, so go over and check the worksheets from the teacher for stuff on the test.
## **Introduction**:
each year the United nations publish a human development report, the report contains adult literacy rates, life expectancy and GDP. this is obviously made for developing countries, where they have the biggest issues with education, health and the economy. its also to bring awareness to those poorer countries so that people like us can help, and maybe make the government contribute.

**per capita GDP**: the total value of all goods / population = per capita GDP.
Japan has 32,475$ per capita
Chad has 1,016$ per capita

**Human development index**: a chart that shows how developed a country is based on Life expectancy, adult literacy rate and GDP per capita. this report overall shows what is the best country to live in.

## **The divided Planet:**
the planet has a massive gap between developed countries and developing countries.

**Developing countries**: commonly known as 3rd world countries, most of the countries are in Africa or countries that intersect the equator.

**Developed countries**: commonly known as 1st world countries, that have a good economy and infrastructure. most of them are in the northern hemisphere.

**Highly indebted poor countries**: developing countries that owe lots of money to developed countries, but is near to 0% of a chance to pay it off. 

**Newly industrialized countries**: new countries like Indonesia which are industrializing by building factories and producing more goods.

**Comparing living standards**: the living standards in developing countries is the same as being in the wilderness without any food or resources around, (its terrible).

**Percentage share of World GDP by countries**: 20% of the richest countries own 86% of the world's economy, meaning that there is a really big gap.

**Measuring Poverty**: its important to measure poverty because poverty in Canada is much better then poverty in a country like Chad or Niger.

**Scatter graph of GDP, observation**: we can obviously see that there is a big gap, between the poor countries and the developed countries.

## **The Poverty Trap**:
its estimated that 800 million people in developing countries are starving or malnourished. even though, the world produces enough food for 6 billion people. and maybe even more.

**The cycle of poverty:** a baby gets born, it doesn't get enough food, the baby's develops slowly, it has poor performance in school, low literacy level causes less likelihood of economic development, baby grows into a adult later in life, and gets married at a young age, since they don't have education, they have many kids and no money. (the cycle repeats)

**The burden of death:** IMF and world bank provide risky loans to countries that can't pay it off, therefor since they can't pay it off most of their economy goes towards the repayment. which makes life even worse. they are stuck in this 20 feet hole with no ladder or any tools.

**World bank and IMF:** the companies that would provide loans to governments, they were mainly established after world war 2 for cities to rebuild.

**Kenya trapped in poverty**: the stereotypical country you expect to fail because of bad farmland, no way to get money and having corrupt government leaders.

**World bank leading by region graph:** East Asia and pacific are leading.

**Highly indebted poor countries map:** countries that are high in debt and can't afford to repay causing them to spend more money on repayment then healthcare.
   
## **The vulnerable ones**:
Women and children are seen without rights, usually it's because of religion or country's culture, which was a thing in developed countries but not anymore because they changed. but they developing countries have not.

**The position of women**: Women in some poor countries don't have rights and can work up to long hours, some

**Amina's Day:** wakes up at 5am, goes to bed at 10pm. she works 17 hours every single day, without a single weekend.

**Women in Niger:** they make little to no money, even though Niger is one of the largest uranium exports.

**Children in Crisis**: child risk, is a big thing, it shows how much risk a child would be if they lived in a country. like war or starvation.

**PNR:** Progress of nations report, is based on child-risk factors that are scaled from 0-100, such as the mortality rate of children under five, children who are underweight, children who did not attend primary school, child at war and risks from diseases.

**UNICEF:** United nations children's fund, which publishes the PNR.

**Comparing Canada to the highest child risk countries:**
Canada: has a rating of less then 5, very safe
Angola: has a rating of 96, very unsafe

**Under-five mortality rate**: most common case is mal-nutrition and starvation.

**Children at war:** 540 million children are at risk because of civil wars, land mines and other armed conflicts.

**Working children:** children who work many hours a day, some taken into legal slavery (food costs: 1$, they make $1 a day.)

## **The Health crisis**:
Many people in developing countries also face health problems such as diseases and access to clean water (with soap).

**Clean water: A basic health**: as of 2025, there is 2.2 billion people without clean water, meaning that 1 in 4 person does not have clean water, which is a big problem, since water is a basic human need that everyone needs.

**Diseases found in water**: diseases can also be found in dirty water, making access to clean drinking water a bigger deal. diseases can impact population growth and the economy as it takes money and effort to deal with it.

**HIV/AIDS**: a virus that destroys your immunity system, making you prone more to other viruses and diseases.

**The HIV/AIDS pandemic**: on top of not having food, you also have to deal with HIV/AIDS simply because you have no clean drinking water, no soap and no education to even know what's going on. life must suck in these countries.

**Epidemic**: diseases outbreak that is spreading in a limited region.

**Pandemic**: a global outbreak that affects everyone.

## **Solutions**:
countries are now easing with the debt repayments, and giving aid!

**Foreign Aid:** countries now give aid to developing countries in Africa.

**Pros and cons of Aid:** the aid that is given is western, meaning that they now have entered the western trade, which is something they might not want.

**Canada's foreign aid program:** Canada gives out money and western equipment to poorer countries.
